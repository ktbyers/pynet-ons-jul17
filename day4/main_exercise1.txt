Build a configuration archiving system.

Requirements.
a. Use either Python or Ansible to retrieve the configs from the two Cisco 
   routers, four Arista switches, Juniper SRX, and four Nexus devices.

b. Using Python and Subprocess check these config files into GIT.

c. Send an email notification if a change occurs. This email notification
   should send the diff of the changes 'git log -p -1'

d. Use ciscoconfparse to analyse the configs of the two Cisco routers. You 
   should search for any 'crypto maps' in the config

Optional - Pull the credentials for the devices from the database. This will
require that you load the four Nexus devices into the database. If you are
using Ansible this will require you construct a dynamic inventory script.
Start with my dynamic inventory script as a starting point.
