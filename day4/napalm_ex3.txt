NAPALM-Ansible Ex3
-------------------

Use NAPALM-Ansible to configure BGP on the NXOS routers. Run iBGP
between the pair of routers.

Use a NAPALM merge operation.

You will need to store the following in a merge file:

router bgp 10
  neighbor {{ peer_ip }} remote-as 10
    address-family ipv4 unicast

Update IP address to reflect the peer IP.
