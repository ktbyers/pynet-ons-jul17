1. Write a Python script that uses Netmiko to configure 3 VLANs on the four Arista
   switches in an indempotent manner.

2. Store your Arista device information in an external Python file and import this 
   information in to your program.

Optional1 - Convert your program to a command-line script that accepts a VLAN ID and a
            VLAN name argument (and then adds/modifies the VLAN in an idempotent way).

Optional2 - Write your program to use threads so this happens concurrently.
