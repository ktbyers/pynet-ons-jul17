Use ntc-ansible line-by-line configuration editing to remove all of the VLANs
from the four Arista switches (except for VLAN1).

Optional - See if you can dynamically retrieve the list of VLANS on each switch
in one task, and then use this list of VLANs in a second task to remove the VLANs.

For reference see:
./day4/ansible21_ex2.yml
