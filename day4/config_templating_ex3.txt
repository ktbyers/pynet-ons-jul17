In the access_switch.j2 template use a Jinja2 for loop to create all of the 
interfaces from FastEthernet 0/1 to FastEthernet 0/24.  Each of the interfaces
should have the following configuration:

>>>>
interface FastEthernet 0/X                    # where X is the interface number
 switchport access vlan {{item.access_vlan}}                
 switchport mode access
 spanning-tree portfast  
>>>>
