Manually SSH to the SRX and execute:

  show lldp neighbors | display xml rpc

From this determine the Junos XML request tag. Use this XML request tag to create a custom RPC
request.

Print the XML retrieved from this to screen. You will probably need the following code to complete
this (xml_out is the XML object retrieved using PyEZ and the custom XML request tag).

  from lxml import etree
  print(etree.tostring(xml_out, encoding='unicode'))
